The directory to create backups in. The project name will be used for the backup folder's prefix.

### On Exit

### Rolling Timestamp

Adds a timestamp to the backup name. This allows historical backups to be created.

* *NONE* - Adds no extra timestamp which would only ever create 1 backup.
* *DATE* - Appends *YYYYMMDD* to the backup name allowing snapshots to be generated daily.
* *EPOCH* - Appends the number of milliseconds that have passed since EPOCH allowing new backups generate on each exit.
